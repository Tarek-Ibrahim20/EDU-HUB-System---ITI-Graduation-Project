# EDU-HUB-System ITI-Graduation-Project

## Description:
EDU HUB is a comprehensive business intelligence system designed to streamline and optimize educational processes within an educational hub environment. This system efficiently stores and manages a variety of critical data including information about students, instructors, courses, enrollments, branches, exams, and feedback.

## Key Features:

### Business Requirements Analysis: 
We initiated the project by meticulously understanding the business requirements. This step laid the foundation for all subsequent development phases.
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): We crafted an ER diagram to represent entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints. This step ensured a clear understanding of the data structure.

Physical Database Implementation: Following the ERD finalization, we translated it into a physical database schema on a SQL server. This involved creating tables, defining columns, data types, constraints, and ensuring data normalization and integrity.
Stored Procedures Development: We developed stored procedures to automate core system operations such as exam creation, answer submission, exam correction, and report generation. Special procedures were designed for generating random exams, collecting student answers, and exam correction.
CRUD Operations: The system supports essential CRUD operations for managing student, course, instructor, and exam-related data. This functionality ensures efficient data management and manipulation.
Exam Management: EDU HUB automates exam generation, stores student responses, and calculates grades. This feature streamlines the examination process and enhances efficiency.
Reporting and Dashboarding: Leveraging Power BI and SSRS, we built comprehensive reports and interactive dashboards to visualize and analyze key metrics and data trends. These tools provide valuable insights for informed decision-making.
