# EDU-HUB-System ITI-Graduation-Project

## Description:
EDU HUB is a comprehensive business intelligence system designed to streamline and optimize educational processes within an educational hub environment. This system efficiently stores and manages a variety of critical data including information about students, instructors, courses, enrollments, branches, exams, and feedback.

## Key Features:

### Business Requirements Analysis: 
We initiated the project by meticulously understanding the business requirements. This step laid the foundation for all subsequent development phases.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): 
We crafted an ER diagram to represent entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints. This step ensured a clear understanding of the data structure.

### Mapping: 
This involved defining tables, columns, data types, and constraints in an SQL environment.

### Physical Database Implementation: 
Following the Mapping finalization, we translated it into a physical database schema on a SQL server by T-SQL. This involved creating tables, defining columns, data types, constraints, and ensuring data normalization and integrity.

### Stored Procedures Development: 
We developed stored procedures to automate core system operations such as exam creation, answer submission, exam correction, and report generation.

CRUD Operations: The system supports essential CRUD operations for managing student, course, instructor, and exam-related data. This functionality ensures efficient data management and manipulation.

Reporting and Dashboarding: Leveraging Power BI and SSRS, we built comprehensive reports and interactive dashboards to visualize and analyze key metrics and data trends. These tools provide valuable insights for informed decision-making.
